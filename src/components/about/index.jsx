            <p>Although there are numerous Decentralised Apps, they all depend on the Domain Registrars to register their identity on internet.</p>
            <p>Our mission is to make the process of registering a domain name more efficient and secure by leveraging the power of blockchain. You can register a domain name with the assurance that your registration is recorded immutably on the blockchain. This means that your registration is secure, transparent, and cannot be tampered with.</p>
